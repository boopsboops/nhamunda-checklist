### Abstract

A wee abstract

### Introduction

The Rio Nhamundá comprises a south draining river of the Guiana Shield. Its ichthyofauna is largely unknown, . Water type is. 

The aim of this study is to report the results of a preliminary survey, and provide biodiversity data in the specimen vouchers, DNA barcodes, georeferenced collection points, and images of both live and preserved materials. We also provide the description of a new species which was collected on the trip.

### Materials and methods

#### Desk survey

In order to assess the amount of public data available for the fishes of the Rio Nhamundá we carried out a survey of the primary Web databases as well as published checklists. Using the search term  online Catalog of Fishes ([http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/Ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp](http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/Ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp)), FishBase ([http://www.fishbase.de](http://www.fishbase.de)) and GBIF ([http://www.gbif.org](http://www.gbif.org)) databases as well as the Checklist of Catfishes (REF: Ferraris, 2006) and CLOFFSCA reveal only a. Given the potential for discrepancies due to the accent on the last letter we searched the following combinations: 'Nhamunda', 'Nhamundá', 'Nhamund' and 'Nhamund&lt;c3&gt;&lt;a1&gt;'. Scripts to repeat the searches are presented in SUPPLEMENTARY.


#### Field sampling techniques

Fishes were collected in the November 2013 dry season using a combination of methods mostly targeting the larger species: gill netting, rod and line, spear fishing, hand netting, and hand catching using snorkelling equipment. Fishes were photographed alive where possible, and then euthanised using a eugenol (clove oil) solution. Tissue samples&mdash;usually from muscle and fin membranes on the right-side pectoral-fin base&mdash;were taken from some specimens and stored in absolute ethanol. Fishes to be retained as vouchers were then fixed in 10% formalin for several days before being transferred to 70% alcohol for long-term storage. 

#### Measurement and meristic techniques

Measurements were taken with dial callipers to a precision of 0.1 mm. All measurements and counts for symmetrical features were taken from the left side of the specimen.  For loricariids, morphometric measurements and meristic counts follow Armbruster (2003), and terminology for lateral plate rows follows Schaefer (1997). Cheek plates odontode counts. Terminology of colour pattern follows Kottelat and Freyhof (2007)<!--Unless otherwise stated, measurements are expressed as percentages of standard length (SL) or head length (HL).--> The symbolic codes for institutional resource collections follows Sabaj Pérez (2013). 

#### Molecular methods

DNA barcodes were generated for one individual per species collected.

### Taxon treatment

#### Description

The holotype of *Pseudolithoxus flavisetus* sp. n. is pictured in Figure 1. Maximum size collected 147.4 mm (PN11 holotype?). Morphometric measurements and meristic values are presented in Table YYY. Body dorso-ventrally compressed, with flattened surfaces both dorsally and ventrally. Head profile rounded. Snout and flanks with bony dermal plates carrying rows of small odontodes. Plating absent from small area at start of lateral line canal at conjunction with pterotic-supracleithrum. Short hypertrophied odontodes on the snout in both females and males, giving a bristly appearance. Short tentacules (fleshy sheaths partially detached from odontodes) on snout and pectoral fins. Abdomen naked. Dorsal operculum of the iris present. Cheek plates evertible to 90&deg; bearing distally-hooked hypertrophied odontodes (21-35, holotype 34). Pectoral fins elongated, when adpressed reaching almost to the insertion of the anal fin in specimens over approximately YYY mm, and carrying long, distally-hooked hypertrophied odontodes through almost their entire length in specimens over YYY mm.

Labial sucking disk large, approximately as wide as is long, lacking fimbriae, and with the ventral surface bearing small buccal papillae. Maxillary barbel short. Teeth villiform and bicuspid. Lateral cusp of teeth roughly one half to two thirds the length of the medial cusp. Tooth numbers ...

Fin-ray counts are as follows: dorsal fin II,7; pectoral fin I,6; pelvic fin I,5; anal fin I,5 (I,2 in one specimen); caudal fin I,14,I (I,13,I in one specimen); dorsal procurrent caudal rays four (three in two specimens); ventral procurrent caudal rays four(three in two specimens). Adipose fin present with short straight spine. All fin spines with odontodes? All branched fin rays with rows of odontodes, with the exception of the anal fin?

Plate counts are as follows: 

Predorsal_plate rows
Middorsal_plates
Lateral_median plates
Midventral plates
Caudal_peduncle plate_rows
Azygous_preadipose plates
Interdorsal_plate rows


Colour pattern of preserved material comprises pale spots on a dark grey background giving the impression of a reticulated pattern. Pattern is present on the head, body and fins. Between the eyes and the insertion of the dorsal fin, the spots are roughly the same size as the pupil, but decrease in size anteriorly, and increase in size posteriorly until they are around the size of the eye on the caudal peduncle. Abdomen pale without pigmentation.The caudal fin has a thin white distal band. Odontodes are a golden-orange colour. In life, the pale spots are a light olive-green colour (Fig YYY).

#### Diagnosis

Following Armbruster and Provenzano (2000), Armbruster (2004), and Lujan and Armbruster (2011), key characters distinguishing *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. from all ancistrin Loricariidae&mdash;except other *Pseudolithoxus*&mdash;are as follows: three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; fully plated snout lacking tentacles; hypertrophied odontodes on the snout in both females and males; lack of whisker-like odontodes on the cheek plates; and extremely hypertrophied odontodes on an elongated pectoral-fin spine in both females and males. LACK fimbriate papillae and have more teeth than  Lithoxus and Exastilithoxus .

Within the genus *Pseudolithoxus*, *P. XXX* sp. n. can be distinguished from: *P. tigris* and *P. kelsorum* by having a colour pattern comprised of spots (vs. bars); from *P. nicoi* and *P. anthrax* by having a colour pattern comprised of large pale spots (generally equal to or larger than pupil diameter) on a dark background vs. small spots (smaller than pupil diameter) on a black background; and from *P. dumus* from having large pale spots on a dark background vs. large dark spots on a light background.

#### Etymology
*Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. is named ...

#### Ecology and distribution

What about the Trombetas specimens?

The species is currently only known from one location on the lower Rio Nhamundá. The type series was collected from shallow (water depth &lt; 1.5 m), fast flowing water over a substrate of eroded bedrock. The fishes were living among the cracks/fissures between the rocks, and were abundant at the sampling site. However, this type of  habitat was not frequently encountered on the lower Nhamundá, and we did not find the species associated with the more common woody-debris sites, or the rocky sites lacking any appreciable water current. Water temperature and conductivity were 28.3&deg;C and 6 &micro;s/cm. Syntopic species encountered during the night survey included: *Leporinus*, *Symphysodon*, *Cichla*, *Pimelodella*, and *Gymnotus*. *Pseudolithoxus* was the dominant loricariid in this habitat.
