## A preliminary inventory of the catfishes of the lower Rio Nhamundá, Brazil, with the description of a new species of *Pseudolithoxus* Isbrücker and Werner (Siluriformes, Loricariidae) 
------
### Abstract

The Rio Nhamundá is a poorly known river draining the southern Guiana Shield. In this study

Our survey results comprise modern biodiversity data in the form of specimen vouchers, georeferenced collection points, tissue samples, DNA barcodes, and images of live fishes.

### Introduction

The Rio Nhamundá is one of the south-draining Guiana Shield tributaries of the Rio Amazonas, Brazil. The river is located between the Uatumã-Jatapú and Trombetas rivers <u>(Figure 1)</u>, and comprises the administrative border between Amazonas State and Pará State. Chemically, the Rio Nhamundá is of the clearwater type (<u>Carvalho de Lima & Araujo-Lima, 2004</u>), being poor in sediments, dissolved minerals, and humic compounds <u>(Crampton, 2011)</u>.

<!--  and is considered by the classification of <u>Lujan and Armbruster (2011)</u> as being one of the "southeastern rivers" of the Guiana Shield. -->

The ichthyofauna of the southern Guiana Shield rivers is poorly known in comparison to the northern Brazilian Shield rivers <u>(Lujan and Armbruster, 2011)</u>, and few scientific collections appear to have been made in the area. One exception is the Trombetas river, which has seen extensive surveys over several years <u>(Ferreira, 1993)</u>. Aquarium hobbyists have, however, explored parts of the Rio Nhamundá in search of new discus (*Symphysodon* spp.) variants (Bleher, 2006/7), and ornamental fishermen currently operate on the river, and specialise mainly in the catching of these discus (pers. obs.).

The aim of this study is to assess our current knowledge of Siluriformes (catfishes) of the Rio Nhamundá, and to report the results of a preliminary survey of the lower reaches of the river. We also provide the description of a new suckermouth catfish species which was collected on the trip.

### Materials and methods

#### Desk survey

In order to assess the current knowledge of the catfishes of the Rio Nhamundá we carried out a survey of Web databases as well as published checklists and literature. The Web databases searched were FishBase <u>(Froese & Pauly, 2014)</u>, Catalog of Fishes <u>(Eschmeyer, 2014)</u>, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; [http://www.gbif.org](http://www.gbif.org)). The FishBase and GBIF searches were conducted using the rfishbase 0.2-2  (Boettiger et al., 2012) and rgbif 0.5.0 (Chamberlain et al., 2014) packages in the R programming language (R Core Team, 2014); scripts to repeat these searches are presented in SUPPLEMENTARY. The Catalog of Fishes was searched manually using their Web interface (date 05-03-14) using the terms "Nhamundá" and "Nhamunda" to avoid potential discrepancies due to the accent on the last letter. Local searches were performed on PDF copies of the Checklist of Catfishes <u>(Ferraris, 2006)</u>, the Check List of the Freshwater Fishes of South and Central America <u>(Reis et al., 2003)</u>, and on over 3,500 locally stored articles on Neotropical ichthyology in PDF format (search script is available in SUPPLEMENTARY). We additionally checked records for the neighbouring Trombetas and Uatumã rivers using rfishbase, rgbif, Catalog of Fishes, and Checklist of Catfishes.

We also checked the collection records at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia (INPA) for records of collections made from the Nhamundá.

#### Field sampling techniques

Fishes were collected during the November 2013 dry season using a combination of methods mostly targeting larger species: gill netting, rod and line fishing, spear fishing, hand netting, and hand catching using snorkelling equipment. Fishes were photographed alive where possible, and then euthanised using a eugenol (clove oil) solution. Tissue samples&mdash;usually from muscle and fin membranes on the right-side pectoral-fin base&mdash;were taken from a subset of specimens and stored in absolute ethanol. Fishes to be retained as vouchers were then fixed in 10% formalin for several days before being transferred to 70% alcohol for long-term storage. 

#### Measurements and meristic techniques

Measurements of preserved material were taken with dial callipers to a precision of 0.1 mm. All measurements and counts for symmetrical features were taken from the left side of the specimen.  For loricariids, morphometric measurements and meristic counts follow <u>Armbruster (2003)</u>, and terminology for lateral plate rows follows <u>Schaefer (1997)</u>. Counts of cheek plate odontodes included only the long, highly hypertrophied odontodes on the posterior part of the plate. The dorsal-fin spinelet is included as a spine, and the nuchal plate is not included in the predorsal plate row count. Terminology of colour pattern follows <u>Kottelat and Freyhof (2007)</u>.<!--Unless otherwise stated, measurements are expressed as percentages of standard length (SL) or head length (HL).--> 

#### Specimen identification

For the checklist, we used published literature to identify our specimens, and we also provide the characters found in those references that we used to make each identification. When required, we examined photographs of type material on the All Species Catfish Inventory Web page ([http://acsi.acnatsci.org](http://acsi.acnatsci.org)). We tried to keep terminology consistent across the species, but also tried to maintain a degree of agreement with original authors' work to aid in referring back to their characters. For example, when reporting the *Farlowella* spp., we refer to the "scutes" of <u>Retzer & Page (2006)</u> as "plates", following <u>Schaefer (1997)</u>, but maintain reference to the "plates of second lateral row" of <u>Retzer & Page (2006)</u> instead of "mid-dorsal lateral plates" of <u>Schaefer (1997)</u>. 

The symbolic codes for institutional resource collections follows <u>Sabaj Pérez (2013)</u>. 

#### Molecular methods

DNA barcodes were generated for one to three individuals per species. DNA was extracted using a ... TBC

We also searched the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD; [http://www.boldsystems.org/](http://www.boldsystems.org/)) and GenBank ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide)) for deposited COI sequences, in order the evaluate the coverage 

### Results: desk survey

Our survey of online databases and published checklists (SUPPLEMENTARY) revealed a single record of a doradid collected in the Rio Nhamundá, which was an unidentified  *Ossancora* sp. On further investigation these fish were found to be paratypes of *Ossancora asterophysa* Birindelli & Sabaj Pérez, 2011 (ROM 88244, MZUSP 7838). The literature survey revealed three further species from the river: *Hassar orestis* (Steindachner, 1875) (MZUSP 9547); *Pygidianops amphioxus* de Pinna & Kirovsky, 2011 (MZUSP 104675); and *Centromochlus* sp. (INPA 35087). The survey of the INPA collections revealed ... 

By contrast, the survey of the Web databases and checklists for the Trombetas river listed 44 siluriform species (SUPPLEMENTARY), while the study of <u>Ferreira (1993)</u> listed 95 siluriform species from the Trombetas. From the Uatumã river, the desk survey of Web databases and checklists provided five species (SUPPLEMENTARY).

### Results: taxon treatment

#### Description

The holotype of *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. is pictured in Figure 2. Morphometric measurements and meristic counts are presented in Table 1. Largest specimen collected was 147.4 mm (holotype<!-- PN11 -->). Body extremely dorso-ventrally compressed, with flattened surfaces both dorsally and ventrally. Shape of head-profile from dorsal view rounded to blunted-square. Head with pronounced medial ridge between nares and snout tip. Dorsal operculum of the iris present.

Sucking disk large, approximately as wide as is long, lacking fimbriae, and with the ventral surface bearing small buccal papillae. Maxillary barbels short. Teeth villiform and bicuspid. Lateral cusp of teeth roughly one-half to two-thirds the length of the medial cusp. Premaxillary teeth 42-81 (median 56, holotype 55). Dentary teeth 33-85 (median 65, holotype 69).

Short hypertrophied odontodes on snout and opercle in both females and males. Cheek plates evertible to 90&deg;, bearing 21-35 long, distally-hooked hypertrophied odontodes (median 30, holotype 34). Pectoral-fin spines also carrying long, distally-hooked hypertrophied odontodes along almost their entire length in mature male specimens over around 100 mm. Short tentacules (fleshy sheaths partially detached from odontodes) present on snout and pectoral fins. 

Pectoral fins extremely elongated, and when adpressed, reach to nearly the insertion of the anal fin in mature male specimens over approximately 100 mm. Fin-ray counts recorded as follows: dorsal fin II,7; pectoral fin I,6; pelvic fin I,5; anal fin I,5 (I,2 in one specimen); caudal fin I,14,I (I,13,I in one specimen); dorsal procurrent caudal rays four (three in two specimens); ventral procurrent caudal rays four (three in two specimens). Adipose fin present with short, straight spine. All fin spines with odontodes. Branched fin rays also bearing odontodes, but significantly fewer on the branched anal-fin rays of small specimens. Caudal fin emarginate with lower lobe slightly longer than upper.

Snout and flanks fully plated. Abdomen naked. Lateral plates carrying rows of small odontodes. Plating absent from small area at start of lateral line canal at conjunction with pterotic-supracleithrum, and from an area at the base of the pelvic fin. Plate counts recorded as follows: predorsal plate rows two; lateral mid-dorsal plates 19-21 (mode 20, holotype 20); lateral median plates 24; lateral mid-ventral plates 19-21 (mode 20, holotype 20); caudal peduncle plate rows three; azygous pre-adipose plates one (two in one specimen); and interdorsal plate rows six-seven (mode seven, holotype six).

Colour pattern of preserved material comprises pale spots on a dark grey background giving the overall impression of reticulations. In life, the pale spots are a light olive-green colour (Fig YYY). Spotted pattern is present on the head, body and fins. Spots increase in size posteriorly, being smaller than the pupil on the snout, and larger than the orbit on the caudal peduncle. Abdomen pale with scattered melanophores. Caudal fin with thin, white distal band. Odontodes golden orange-yellow, with darker orange tips. 

Sexual dimorphism is subtle in *Pseudolithoxus*. In mature individuals of *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n., the shape of the pelvic fin was seen to differ; in males the third branched ray is noticeably longer than the first branched ray, where in females it is roughly the same length. Males also appear to have longer pectoral-fin spines carrying longer odontodes. <!-- examples: PN09 female and PN10 male.-->

#### Diagnosis

Following <u>Armbruster and Provenzano (2000)</u>, <u>Armbruster (2004)</u>, and <u>Lujan and Armbruster (2011)</u>, key characters distinguishing *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. from all ancistrin Loricariidae&mdash;except other *Pseudolithoxus*&mdash;are as follows: three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; lateral plates without pronounced keels; fully plated snout lacking tentacles; hypertrophied odontodes on the snout in both females and males; lack of whisker-like odontodes on the cheek plates; extremely hypertrophied odontodes on an elongated pectoral-fin spine in both females and males; sucking disk without fimbriae; and greater than 20 teeth per jaw ramus.

Within the genus *Pseudolithoxus*, *P. XXX* sp. n. can be distinguished from: *P. tigris* and *P. kelsorum* by having a colour pattern comprised of spots (vs. bars); from *P. dumus* from having large pale spots on a dark background vs. large dark spots on a light background; and from *P. nicoi* and *P. anthrax* by having a colour pattern comprised of large pale spots generally equal to or larger than pupil diameter posterior to the head on a dark background vs. dots much smaller than pupil diameter on a black background.

#### Etymology
*Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. is named ... . In the German aquarium literature, fishes of this genus are known as  due to their wing-like elongated pectoral-fins <u>(Seidel & Evers, 2005)</u>. We propose the English vernacular name "... flyer catfish", and propose the Portuguese vernacular name "acarí-bodó ..." for the species.

#### Ecology and distribution

<!-- What about the 1993 Trombetas specimens at INPA?-->

The species is currently only known from one location on the main river stem of the lower Rio Nhamundá. The type series was collected in shallow (depth &lt; 1.5 m), fast flowing water over a substrate of eroded bedrock. The fishes were living among the narrow cracks between the rocks, and were abundant at the sampling site. However, this type of  habitat was not frequently encountered on the lower Nhamundá, and we did not find the species associated with the more common woody-debris sites, or the rocky sites lacking any appreciable water current. Water temperature and conductivity were 28.3&deg;C and 6 &micro;s/cm. Syntopic species encountered during the night survey included: *Leporinus*, *Symphysodon*, *Cichla*, *Pimelodella*, and *Gymnotus*. *Pseudolithoxus* was the dominant loricariid in this habitat.

#### Molecular data
Three paratypes of *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. (CTGA_NNN) were sequenced for the COI DNA barcode region, and following the 'GenSeq' nomenclature of <u>Chakrabarty et al., (2013)</u> these specimens bear the 'genseq-2 COI' annotation. The sequences were NNN bp in length and variability ... TBC. GenBank accession numbers are listed in Materials.

#### *Auchenipterichthys longimanus* (Günther, 1864)

##### Notes
Identification to species level follows <u>Ferraris et al. (2005)</u> based on the following characters: coracoid not exposed ventrally; pelvic fin with branched rays; anterior teeth on premaxilla not visible when mouth closed; caudal fin emarginate; and body uniform dark colouration without dark spots.

Three individuals were caught by hand from their lodgements in woody substrates at the margin of the main river stem. Water temperature was 28.9&deg;C. An example of a live specimen is pictured in Figure YYY.

#### *Tatia* aff. *musaica* Royero, 1992

##### Notes 
<!-- need to check INPA specimens of Centromochlus sp. (musaica?) (INPA 35087) collected from the Nhamunda -->

Identification to species level follows <u>Royero (1993)</u>, <u>Sarmento-Soares & Martins-Pinheiro (2008)</u> and <u>Vari & Ferraris (2013)</u>
based on the following characters: irregular, mosaic-like black and white colour pattern; bifid third nuchal plate; and long post-cleithral process reaching past the nuchal plates. Our specimens, however, differ from those described/pictured by <u>Royero (1993)</u> in a number of aspects: unpigmented area dorso-posteriorly to the orbit (slightly elongated and smaller than orbit diameter); third nuchal plate larger than that figured by <u>Royero (1993)</u>; third nuchal plate unpigmented (including some of the surrounding skin); caudal fin hyaline with oblique dark stripes reaching to tips of upper and lower lobes.

Twelve individuals were caught either by hand from their lodgements in woody substrates, or more effectively using a hand net at the surface after attracting insects&mdash;on which they were feeding&mdash;with a light; under such conditions they appeared abundant on the lower Nhamundá.

<!-- El cuerpo es gris oscuro, o casi negro hacia la región dorsal del cuerpo y en los flancos, con una serie de proyeciones de pigmentación oscura hacia el vientre, a manera de mosaico (Fig. I y 6). La parte subterminal de la mandíbula inferior y toda la región ventral, hasta el origen de la aleta anal, no tiene pigmentación; en el material preservado es de color  blanco. La pigmentación que se proyecta sobre el víentre presenta variaciones, pero en todos los ejemplares examinados dos existe una proyección anterior a la aleta pélvica, otra en la parte anterior de la aleta  anal y otros sobre os pedúnculo caudal.

La cabeza es completamente oscura, extendiéndose los pigmentos desde la región dorsal hasta debajo de la órbita. En la mandíbula inferior, y debajo de la barbillas, aparece una franja de pigmentos oscuros. La porción membranosa del opérculo no ostenta pigmentación.

La aleta dorsal es oscura a nivel de la base y tiene numerosos pigmentos en la espina. Los dos primeros radios ramifícados son oscuros bacia la región media. La aleta pectoral es hialina, sólo la espina y el primer radio tienen pigmentacion. Las aletas pélvicas y anal solo están pigmentadas en la base. La aleta adiposa es hialina, con pocos pigmentos en la base. La aleta caudal es oscura, con varíaciones en diferentes individuos, aunque en la mayoría se presenta una banda oscura tenue hacia la región distal.

####*Goeldiella eques* (Müller & Troschel, 1849)

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Eigenmann & Norris (1900)</u> and <u>Eigenmann (1912)</u> based on the following characters: rounded caudal fin with larger lower lobe; distinct cranial fontanelle; maxillary barbels long, extending to caudal (extended only to caudal peduncle in our specimen); dorsal spine notched anteriorly; dark stripe along lateral line (in our specimen this comprised just a elongated blotch under the dorsal fin); base of caudal with dark bar; and obliquely angled dark saddle behind head (from dorsal insertion to base of opercle); body and fins irregularly mottled.

One individual was caught by hand-net on the Rio Paratucu (Rio Nhamundá tributary), and delivered a painful sting, confirming that many heptapterids are venomous <u>(Wright, 2009)</u>. This specimen is pictured in Figure YYY.

##### Notes

Identification to genus level follows <u>Eigenmann & Eigenmann (1890)</u> and <u>Eigenmann (1917)</u>based on the following characters: occipital process narrow, reaching dorsal plate; fontanel continued to base of occipital process, with bridge above the posterior margin of the eye; dorsal-fin and pectoral-fin spines strong; humeral process spine-like; dorsal fin with six branched rays. 

We are currently unable to identify this fish to species level given the large diversity and paucity of modern treatments of the genus. Important characters include the caudal fin lobes of approximately equal length, short barbels, the complete lack of dark longitudinal stripe, the wedge-shaped mark on the dorsal-fin, and the dark saddle anterior to the dorsal fin.

#### *Ancistrus* aff. *macrophthalmus* (Pellegrin, 1912) <!-- or sp. 'buceta'  -->

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Armbruster (2004)</u>, <u>Kner (1854)</u>, <u>Muller et al. (1994)</u>, <u>Günther (1864)</u>, <u>Pellegrin (1912)</u>, and <u>Eigenmann (1912)</u>  based on the following characters: three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; snout naked with fleshy tentacles lacking odontodes; body and head wide and extremely flattened; snout long and pointed; seven branched dorsal rays; three branched anal fin rays; six branched pectoral fin rays; eyes large (orbit diameter approximately 20% of HL) and situated high on the head; narrow gill openings; and colouration black, with small tiny yellow-white dots in life.

Among the several similar described *Ancistrus*&mdash;e.g. *A. dolichopterus*  Kner, 1854, *A. hoplogenys* (Günther, 1864), *A. leucostictus* (Günther, 1864), *A. ranunculus* Muller, Rapp Py-Daniel & Zuanon, 1994&mdash;this fish is most similar in shape of head and eyes to *A. macrophthalmus* (Pellegrin, 1912) and *A. lithurgicus* Eigenmann, 1912; however, the fish from the lower Nhamundá has just three branched anal-fin rays, compared to four for both of these species. More individuals will need to be collected, and further investigation of available names in *Ancistrus* carried out in order to be sure that this represents an undescribed species.

#### *Dekeyseria scaphirhyncha* (Kner, 1854) 

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Armbruster (2004)</u>, <u>Rapp-Py Daniel (1985)</u> and <u>La Monte (1929)</u> based on the following characters: lateral plates with well-developed keels; hypertrophied odontodes present along snout margin; three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; large interorbital distance; pronounced medial ridge on snout; head plates with sinuous rows of odontodes; interopercular plate with between 15 and 20 strong and distally hooked odontodes; pectoral spine roughly same length as head, with long odontodes; and spots on body roughly same size as those on head.

Nine individuals were caught by hand from woody substrates in a variety of habitats (main river, lake, igarapé). The species was abundant. An example of a live specimen is pictured in Figure YYY.

#### *Farlowella nattereri* Steindachner, 1910

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Retzer & Page (1997)</u> and <u>Retzer (2006)</u> based on the following characters: seven predorsal plates; dorsal fin located opposite anal fin; three rows of abdominal plates; five rows of anterior lateral plates, with middle row incomplete; plates of second lateral row diamond-shaped; fourth row of anterior lateral plates sharply keeled; odontodes on lateral plates small; snout-mouth-length / head-length &gt; 0.5; body-depth / pelvic-fin-length &lt; 0.86; pectoral-fin-length / snout-mouth-length &gt; 0.65; snout-mouth-length / pectoral-fin-length &gt; 1.0; fin spines and rays with dark spots. 

The above characters are consistent with *F. nattereri*, but some key differences in colour pattern are noted. <u>Retzer & Page (1997)</u> report that: for most specimens of *F. nattereri*, the first anal and dorsal fin rays are entirely darkly pigmented (our specimen has spotted rays); a distinct dorso-lateral dark-stripe is present from base of snout to dorsal fin (this stripe was not apparent in the preserved specimen, but was observed in life); upper and lower caudal fin lobes pigmented
with dark stripes of equal size, with stripes often not reaching caudal fin base (the stripes in our specimen reached the caudal base). <u>Retzer & Page (1997)</u> recognise that *F. nattereri* probably comprises a complex of species.

#### *Hypancistrus* aff. *furunculus* Armbruster, Lujan & Taphorn, 2007 <!-- or furunculus-->

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Armbruster et al. (2007)</u> and <u>Armbruster (2008)</u> based on the following characters: five rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; lateral plates not keeled; dentaries forming angle of &lt; 90&deg;; dentary teeth almost twice as long as premaxillary teeth; dentary teeth widely spaced with medial gap between tooth cups as wide as the tooth cups themselves; supraorbital crests very distinct; dark E-shaped pattern on snout (irregular in some individuals); pattern on body of oblique dark bands (almost horizontal wavy stripes in some individuals), with dark bands generally wider than pale bands (i.e. body more dark coloured than pale coloured); dorsal fin with complete bands; and caudal fin with dark vertical bands.

The *Hypancistrus* from the Nhamundá is similar to *H. furunculus* Armbruster, Lujan & Taphorn (2007), but we hypothesise that this species represents a distinct species due to the pronounced supraorbital crests, wide gap between the dentary tooth cups, and colour pattern of wide dark bands and thin pale bands. Comparison to the type material of *H. furunculus* is necessary to confirm or refute these hypotheses.

<!--*Hypancistrus* represents a diverse group of which many species are undescribed. They differ mainly in subtleties in colour pattern and body shape, so description of this possible new species would be premature until characters useful to the group are better characterised, and more collections are made, particularly from other South draining Guiana Shield rivers.

Twelve individuals were caught by hand at night from rocky substrates near the mouth of the river. Water current was minimal, and the temperature was 32.0&deg;C. Four examples of live specimens are pictured in Figure YYY to illustrate variation in colour pattern.

#### *Hypoptopoma incognitum* Aquino & Schaefer, 2010

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Aquino & Schaefer (2010)</u> based on the following characters: flattened head with eyes placed ventrolaterally and visible from below; laterally expanded nuchal plate; six pairs of lateral abdominal plates posterior to coracoids; thoracic plates present; three midventral plates between cleithral posterior process and first plate of ventral series; anal shield composed of single plate; second infraorbital laterally contacting to two ventral dermal plates; patch of odontodes present on anterolateral aspect of cleithrum at opening to branchial chamber; and caudal fin with series of around three dark bands (irregular in our specimens). 

Thirteen individuals were caught by hand from submerged terrestrial vegetation. Water current was minimal. An example of a live specimen is pictured in Figure YYY.

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Zawadzki et al.

#### *Lasiancistrus schomburgkii* (Günther, 1864)

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Armbruster (2005)</u> based on the following characters: three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; bar-shaped opercle; snout plates present; lateral plates not keeled; &gt; 30 teeth per jaw ramus; body and fins (except dorsal and caudal) dark with small pale dots; plates not outlined with dark pigment; and caudal fin with darker lower lobe. We note that the whisker-like odontodes characteristic of the genus were not apparent in our single, juvenile specimen of 45.2 mm, but we did observe bifurcating tentacules on the interopercular plate, and combined with the other characters, are confident that the specimen belongs to *Lasiancistrus schomburgkii* as proposed by <u>Armbruster (2005)</u>.

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Armbruster (2004)</u>, <u>Armbruster (2008)</u> and <u>Isbrücker & Nijssen (1989)</u> based on the following characters: premaxilla with three teeth, the inner being very long; lips oval, lacking fimbriae on the upper lip; more than four predorsal plates; tall and narrow supraoccipital crest; and dark body with numerous white dots.

#### *Loricaria cataphracta* Linnaeus, 1758 

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Isbrücker (1981)</u>, <u>Thomas & Rapp Py-Daniel (2008)</u> and <u>Thomas & Sabaj Pérez (2010)</u> based on the following characters: elongate lip filaments; three premaxillary teeth per ramus; premaxillary teeth approximately twice as long as dentary teeth; developed odontode crests on head and dorsal trunk plates; 34 lateral plates; 19 coalesced lateral plates; dorsal fin spine not elongated (24% of SL); post-orbital notch relatively well developed; abdomen mostly plated (with the exception of an anterior v-shaped naked area over the pectoral girdle); all fins except anal fin with dark sub-distal bands (most prominent on caudal and dorsal fins).

Identification of this species is tentative, as there appears to be considerable variation in the *L. cataphracta* group; we await the forthcoming systematic revision of the genus (Thomas & Sabaj Pérez, 2010).

#### *Peckoltia vittata* (Steindachner, 1881)

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Armbruster (2008)</u> based on the following characters: evertible cheek plates with &gt; 10 hypertrophied odontodes; dentaries forming angle of &lt; 90&deg;; deep body, not dorso-ventrally flattened; lips lacking fimbriae; villiform teeth of equal size in premaxilla and dentary; colour pattern of four irregular dorsal saddles (first and second are usually combined in small specimens); dorsal and caudal fins without orange margin (in life); head plates not outlined in black; dark bar between eyes, and e-shaped dark blotch on the snout (broken in some specimens); and fins with dark and light bands of approximately equal width (irregular in some specimens). 

An interesting observation is that our specimens exhibited variation in terms of the degree of abdomen plating and markings: adult specimens from rocky collection points near the mouth of the river showed complete abdomen plating and a vermiculated pattern (Fig YYY); those from further up the river lacked abdomen plating and associated colouration (with the exception of one individual that was partially plated with discrete spots).

Twenty-eight individuals were caught by hand from both woody substrates and rocky substrates. NNN examples of live specimens are pictured in Figure YYY to illustrate variation in abdomen plating and colour pattern.

#### *Pseudoplatystoma reticulatum* Eigenmann & Eigenmann, 1889

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Buitrago-Suárez & Burr (2007)</u> and based on the following characters: head strongly depressed with extended cranial fontanelle; loop-like dark bars forming reticulated pattern which extends far below lateral line and connects dorsally; no clear demarcation between dark dorsal and pale ventral regions; and caudal fin with fewer than 45 spots.

While we follow the taxonomy of <u>Buitrago-Suárez & Burr (2007)</u>, we also consider the possibility that *P. reticulatum* Eigenmann & Eigenmann, 1889 is a junior subjective synonym of *P. fasciatum* (Linnaeus), in light of the study of <u>Carvalho-Costa et al. (2011)</u>, who reported minimal genetic differentiation among the taxa considered conspecific with *P. fasciatum* previous to the study of <u>Buitrago-Suárez & Burr (2007)</u>.

Four individuals were caught at night using gill nets \[Val, where were these set?\]. The *Pseudoplatystoma* specimens were not retained as vouchers. An example of two live specimens is pictured in Figure YYY.

#### *Batrochoglanis villosus* (Eigenmann, 1912)

##### Notes

Identification to species level follows <u>Shibatta & Pavanelli (2005)</u>, <u>Mees (1974)</u> and <u>Eigenmann (1912)</u> based on the following characters: lower jaw not projecting beyond upper jaw; head large and rounded in dorsal view; head and body with numerous small papillae; insertion of pelvic fin though vertical of posterior base of dorsal; short caudal peduncle; rounded caudal fin; post-cleithral process short, not reaching vertical through dorsal-fin origin; axillary pore absent; lateral-line canal terminating on caudal peduncle; premaxillary dentigerous plates with lateral margins posteriorly prolonged; colour brown, with dark mottled appearance; and caudal fin with dark dots irregularly distributed. 

An important inconsistency should be noted regarding the caudal fin shape. <u>Eigenmann (1912)</u> described the caudal fin of *B. villosus* as being "notched", but figured a specimen with a rounded caudal fin (<u>Mees, 1974</u>). The photograph of the holotype (FMNH 53219) on the All Species Catfish Inventory Web page ([http://acsi.acnatsci.org/base/image_list.html?mode=genus&genus=Pseudopimelodus](http://acsi.acnatsci.org/base/image_list.html?mode=genus&genus=Pseudopimelodus)) shows a fish lacking most of the caudal fin. The specimens we collected had a  rounded caudal fin.

### Discussion and Conclusions

#### Checklist



Our desk survey shows that few ichthyological surveys of the Rio Nhamundá have taken place, and that our survey is one of the first to be made on the river.  Range extensions for many species

The taxonomic composition of the collection is interesting. While many of the species recorded were cosmopolitan species of the lowland Amazon, such as  *Auchenipterichthys longimanus*, *Trachycorystes trachycorystes*, *Goeldiella eques*, *Hypoptopoma incognitum*, *Lasiancistrus schomburgkii*, *Loricaria cataphracta*, *Pseudoloricaria laeviuscula*, *Rineloricaria lanceolata*, *Calophysus macropterus*, and *Phractocephalus hemioliopterus*&mdash;which can be expected to be found in the lower reaches of many Amazon draining tributaries&mdash;there are suggestions of connections to more specialised faunas. The presence of *Ancistrus dolichopterus*, *Dekeyseria scaphirhyncha*, and *Hypostomus carinatus*, for example, suggest links to the Rio Negro fauna. Some of the species, such as *Tatia nigra* are only known from other south draining rivers of the Guiana Shield, such as the neighbouring Uatumã and Trombetas rivers. Three species appear to have connections with the Orinoco river, being *Hypancistrus* aff. *furunculus*, *Tatia* aff. *musaica*, and *Pseudolithoxus XXX*. The affiliation of some such as *Leporacanthicus galaxias* and *Peckoltia vittata* are from the north draining Brazilian Shield rivers including the Tocantins, Tapajós, and Xingu.

<!-- possibly endemics to the Rio Nhamundá,  -->

Detecting presence of restricted range fishes is important in setting conservation priorities <u>(Nogueira et al., 2010)</u>. Further surveys upstream above the rapids may well show more endemics <u>(Alofs et al., 2014)</u>. 

This checklist is clearly incomplete, missing entirely, for example, callichthyids, trichomycterids and aspredinids. Habitats, such as igarapés&mdash;which are more likely to yield these families&mdash;were only superficially sampled.

Our results show that even rapid surveys can make valuable additions to biodiversity, with the discovery of new species and the range extensions for known species and adding to the data known on a species. The study also highlights the paucity of neotropical ichthyological data in GBIF data, and makes a small contribution. In addition to the traditional forms of data collected on biodiversity surveys (e.g. preserved specimen vouchers), our study provides "new" types of data in the form of DNA barcodes and images of the specimens' live colour pattern. These data will be invaluable in future studies addressing difficult groups. DNA barcodes from type material.

#### New species

<u>Armbruster & Provenzano (2000)</u> described four species of *Lasiancistrus* from the Upper Orinoco drainage, which were later moved by Isbrücker & Werner <u>(Isbrücker et al., 2001)</u> to the new genus *Pseudolithoxus*. <u>Lujan & Birindelli (2011)</u> later added an additional barred species to the genus, *P. kelsorum*, also from the upper Orinoco. 

*Pseudolithoxus XXX* is the first of the genus reported from Brazil, and in particular the first from the Amazon-draining southern rivers of the Guiana Shield, raising interesting biogeographic questions about dispersal routes, vicariant events, and zoogeographic filters. 

<!-- *P. nicoi* from the Casiquiare Canal is likely to be also found in the Upper Rio Negro of Brazil. -->
