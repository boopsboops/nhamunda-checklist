### Abstract

A wee abstract

### Introduction

The Rio Nhamundá is a south draining river of the Guiana Shield. Its ichthyofauna is largely unknown, . Water type is. 

The aim of this study is to report the results of a preliminary survey, and provide biodiversity data in the specimen vouchers, DNA barcodes, georeferenced collection points, and images of both live and preserved materials. We also provide the description of a new suckermouth catfish species which was collected on the trip.

### Materials and methods

#### Desk survey

In order to assess the availability of public data on the fishes of the Rio Nhamundá we carried out a survey of the primary Web databases as well as published checklists. We searched Catalog of Fishes ([http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/Ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp](http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/Ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp)), FishBase ([http://www.fishbase.de](http://www.fishbase.de)) and GBIF ([http://www.gbif.org](http://www.gbif.org)) databases, as well as the Checklist of Catfishes <u>(Ferraris, 2006)</u> and CLOFFSCA (insert ref) reveal only a. Given the potential for discrepancies due to the accent on the last letter we searched the following combinations: 'Nhamundá', 'Nhamunda', and 'Nhamund&lt;c3&gt;&lt;a1&gt;'. The FishBase and GBIF searches were conducted using the rfishbase (CITE) and rGBIF (CITE); scripts to repeat these searches where possible are presented in SUPPLEMENTARY.


#### Field sampling techniques

Fishes were collected in the November 2013 dry season using a combination of methods mostly targeting the larger species: gill netting, rod and line, spear fishing, hand netting, and hand catching using snorkelling equipment. Fishes were photographed alive where possible, and then euthanised using a eugenol (clove oil) solution. Tissue samples&mdash;usually from muscle and fin membranes on the right-side pectoral-fin base&mdash;were taken from some specimens and stored in absolute ethanol. Fishes to be retained as vouchers were then fixed in 10% formalin for several days before being transferred to 70% alcohol for long-term storage. 

#### Measurement and meristic techniques

Measurements were taken with dial callipers to a precision of 0.1 mm. All measurements and counts for symmetrical features were taken from the left side of the specimen.  For loricariids, morphometric measurements and meristic counts follow <u>Armbruster (2003)</u>, and terminology for lateral plate rows follows Schaefer (1997). Counts of cheek plate odontodes included only the long, highly hypertrophied odontodes on the posterior part of the plate. The dorsal-fin spinelet is included as a spine, and the nuchal plate is not included in the predorsal plate row count. Terminology of colour pattern follows <u>Kottelat and Freyhof (2007)</u>.<!--Unless otherwise stated, measurements are expressed as percentages of standard length (SL) or head length (HL).--> The symbolic codes for institutional resource collections follows <u>Sabaj Pérez (2013)</u>. 

#### Molecular methods

DNA barcodes were generated for one individual per species collected.

### Results: taxon treatment

#### Description

The holotype of *Pseudolithoxus flavisetus* sp. n. is pictured in Figure 1. Morphometric measurements and meristic counts are presented in Table 1. Largest specimen collected was 147.4 mm (holotype<!-- PN11 -->). Body extremely dorso-ventrally compressed, with flattened surface both dorsally and ventrally. Head profile shape from dorsal view, rounded to blunted-square. Head with pronounced medial ridge between nares and snout tip. Dorsal operculum of the iris present.

Sucking disk large, approximately as wide as is long, lacking fimbriae, and with the ventral surface bearing small buccal papillae. Maxillary barbels short. Teeth villiform and bicuspid. Lateral cusp of teeth roughly one-half to two-thirds the length of the medial cusp. Premaxillary teeth 42-81 (median 56, holotype 55). Dentary teeth 33-85 (median 65, holotype 69).

Short hypertrophied odontodes on snout and opercle in both females and males. Cheek plates evertible to 90&deg;, bearing 21-35 long, distally-hooked hypertrophied odontodes (median 30, holotype 34). Pectoral-fin spines also carrying long, distally-hooked hypertrophied odontodes along almost their entire length in mature male specimens over around 100 mm. Short tentacules (fleshy sheaths partially detached from odontodes) present on snout and pectoral fins. 

Pectoral fins extremely elongated, and when adpressed, reach to nearly the insertion of the anal fin in mature male specimens over approximately 100 mm. Fin-ray counts recorded as follows: dorsal fin II,7; pectoral fin I,6; pelvic fin I,5; anal fin I,5 (I,2 in one specimen); caudal fin I,14,I (I,13,I in one specimen); dorsal procurrent caudal rays four (three in two specimens); ventral procurrent caudal rays four (three in two specimens). Adipose fin present with short, straight spine. All fin spines with odontodes. Branched fin rays also bearing odontodes, but significantly fewer on the branched anal-fin rays of small specimens. Caudal fin emarginate with lower lobe slightly longer than upper.

Snout and flanks fully plated. Abdomen naked. Lateral plates carrying rows of small odontodes. Plating absent from small area at start of lateral line canal at conjunction with pterotic-supracleithrum, and from an area at the base of the pelvic fin. Plate counts recorded as follows: predorsal plate rows two; lateral mid-dorsal plates 19-21 (mode 20, holotype 20); lateral median plates 24; lateral mid-ventral plates 19-21 (mode 20, holotype 20); caudal peduncle plate rows three; azygous pre-adipose plates one (two in one specimen); and interdorsal plate rows six-seven (mode seven, holotype six).

Colour pattern of preserved material comprises pale spots on a dark grey background giving the overall impression of reticulations. In life, the pale spots are a light olive-green colour (Fig YYY). Spotted pattern is present on the head, body and fins. Spots increase in size posteriorly, being smaller than the pupil on the snout, and larger than the orbit on the caudal peduncle. Abdomen pale with scattered melanophores. Caudal fin with thin, white distal band. Odontodes golden orange-yellow, with darker orange tips. 

Sexual dimorphism is subtle in *Pseudolithoxus*. In mature individuals of *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n., the shape of the pelvic fin was seen to differ; in males the third branched ray is noticeably longer than the first branched ray, where in females it is roughly the same length. Males also appear to have longer pectoral-fin spines carrying longer odontodes. <!-- examples: PN09 female and PN10 male.-->

#### Diagnosis

Following <u>Armbruster and Provenzano (2000)</u>, <u>Armbruster (2004)</u>, and <u>Lujan and Armbruster (2011)</u>, key characters distinguishing *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. from all ancistrin Loricariidae&mdash;except other *Pseudolithoxus*&mdash;are as follows: three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; lateral plates without pronounced keels; fully plated snout lacking tentacles; hypertrophied odontodes on the snout in both females and males; lack of whisker-like odontodes on the cheek plates; extremely hypertrophied odontodes on an elongated pectoral-fin spine in both females and males; sucking disk without fimbriae; and greater than 20 teeth per jaw ramus.

Within the genus *Pseudolithoxus*, *P. XXX* sp. n. can be distinguished from: *P. tigris* and *P. kelsorum* by having a colour pattern comprised of spots (vs. bars); from *P. dumus* from having large pale spots on a dark background vs. large dark spots on a light background; and from *P. nicoi* and *P. anthrax* by having a colour pattern comprised of large pale spots generally equal to or larger than pupil diameter posterior to the head on a dark background vs. dots much smaller than pupil diameter on a black background.

#### Ecology and distribution

<!-- What about the 1993 Trombetas specimens at INPA?-->

The species is currently only known from one location on the main river stem of the lower Rio Nhamundá. The type series was collected in shallow (depth &lt; 1.5 m), fast flowing water over a substrate of eroded bedrock. The fishes were living among the narrow cracks between the rocks, and were abundant at the sampling site. However, this type of  habitat was not frequently encountered on the lower Nhamundá, and we did not find the species associated with the more common woody-debris sites, or the rocky sites lacking any appreciable water current. Water temperature and conductivity were 28.3&deg;C and 6 &micro;s/cm. Syntopic species encountered during the night survey included: *Leporinus*, *Symphysodon*, *Cichla*, *Pimelodella*, and *Gymnotus*. *Pseudolithoxus* was the dominant loricariid in this habitat.
