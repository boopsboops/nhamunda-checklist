### Abstract

A wee abstract

### Introduction

The Rio Nhamundá comprises a south draining river of the Guiana Shield. Its ichthyofauna is largely unknown, . Water type is.

The aim of this study is to report the results of a preliminary survey, and provide biodiversity data in the specimen vouchers, DNA barcodes, georeferenced collection points, and images of both live and presevered materials. We also provide the description of a new species which was collected on the trip.

### Materials and methods

#### Desk survey

In order to assess the amount of public data available for the fishes of the Rio Nhamundá we carried out a survey of the primary Web databases as well as published checklists. Using the search term  online Catalog of Fishes ([http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/Ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp](http://researcharchive.calacademy.org/research/Ichthyology/catalog/fishcatmain.asp)), FishBase ([http://www.fishbase.de](http://www.fishbase.de)) and GBIF ([http://www.gbif.org](http://www.gbif.org)) databases as well as the Checklist of Catfishes (REF: Ferraris, 2006) and CLOFFSCA reveal only a. Given the potential for dispcrepancies due to the accent on the last letter we searched the following combinations: 'Nhamunda', 'Nhamundá', 'Nhamund' and 'Nhamund<c3><a1>'. Scripts to repeat the searches are presented in SUPPLEMENTARY.


#### Field sampling techniques

Fishes were collected in the November 2013 dry season using a combination of methods mostly targeting the larger species: gill netting, rod and line, spear fishing, hand netting, and hand catching using snorkeling equipment. Fishes were photographed alive, euthanised using clove oil anaesthetic, and tissue samples&mdash;usually from right side pectoral fin base&mdash;were taken fromm some specimens and stored in absolute ethanol. Vouchers were then fixed in 10% formalin for several days before being transfered to 70% alcohol for long-term storage. 

#### Measurement and meristic techniques

Measurements were taken with dial calipers to a precision of 0.1 mm. All measurements and counts for symmetrical features were taken from the left side of the specimen.

#### Molecular methods

DNA barcodes were generated for one individual per species collected.

### Taxon treatment

#### Description

The holotype of *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. nov. is pictured in Figure 1. Maximum size collected 147.4 mm (holotype?). Morphometric measurements and meristic values are presented in Table YYY.  Body highly dorso-ventrally compressed, with flattened surfaces both dorsally and ventrally. Snout and flanks with bony dermal plates carrying odontodes. Odontodes hypertrophied on the snout in both females and males, giving an appearance of short bristles. Abdomen naked. Lateral line canal present. Dorsal iris-operculum present. Plating absent from small area at start of lateral line canal at conjunction with pterotic-supracleithrum. Cheek plates evertible to 90&deg; with distally hooked hypertrophied odontodes (21-35, holotype 34). Pectoral fins highly elongated, reaching past the distal tip of the pelvic fin in specimens over YYY mm.

Mouth large, approximately as wide as it is long, with papillated lips. Max

Dorsal fin II,7. Pectoral fin I,6. Pelvic  fin I,5. Anal fin I,5 (I,2 in one specimen).

#### Diagnosis

Following Armbruster and Provenzano (2000), Armbruster (2004), and Lujan and Armbruster (2011), key characters distinguishing *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. nov. from all ancistrin Loricariidae&mdash;except other *Pseudolithoxus*&mdash;are as follows: three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; fully plated snout lacking tentacles or tentacules; hypertrophied odontodes on the snout in both females and males; lack of whisker-like odontodes on the cheek plates; and extremely hypertrophied odontodes on an elongated pectoral-fin spine in both females and males.

Within the genus *Pseudolithoxus*, *P. XXX* sp. nov. can be distinguished from: *P. tigris* and *P. kelsorum* by having a colour pattern comprised of spots (vs. bars); from *P. nicoi* and *P. anthrax* by having a colour pattern comprised of large pale spots (generally equal to or larger than pupil diameter) on a dark background vs. small spots (smaller than pupil diameter) on a black background; and from *P. dumus* from having large pale spots on a dark background vs. large dark spots on a light background.
