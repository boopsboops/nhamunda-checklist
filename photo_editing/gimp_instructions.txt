open image
save as '.xcf'
duplicate layer
new layer with black foreground colour
add black 'layer mask' to new foreground layer
hide the duplicated layer
paint over the black layer in white to hide, and in black to reveal
use airbrush for fine details and to blend
select the image layer, and use the 'Unsharp mask' (Filters > Enhance > Unsharp Mask)
to correct marks and bits of shit, use the 'Healing tool'

if need colour other than black, select the colour box in the layers list, and apply the 'bucket fill'

to export, make a rectangle around the image, right click, and 'copy visible'
right click again, and 'Edit > Paste as > New image'
then in the new image, go 'File > Export > Tiff' resizing if required in 'Image > Scale image'

if need to rotate, copy square, and 'Paste as > New layer'
toggle the other layers on off to make easier, then go to Layer > Transform > Arbitrary rotation'
repeat export with new rectangle

best to copy the rotated and cropped selection into a new, temporary image, and then rescale to 3000px followed by subtle unsharp mask (radius 3, amount 0.35). save at 90% to get around 1mb file.
